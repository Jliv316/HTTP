#The game will work like this:

# When a player starts a new game, the server picks a 
#random number between 0 and 100.
require 'pry'
class Game
    #generate a random number 0 to 100
    random_number = rand(0..100)
    #take in path 

end








# The player can make a new guess by sending a POST 
#request containing the number they want to guess.
# When the player requests the game path, the server should
# show some information about the game including how many 
#guesses have been made, what the most recent guess was, 
#and whether it was too high, too low, or correct.
